Welcome !

Please, check out the more detailed presentation here:

These projetcs are the result of the collaboration with a photographer and
engineers in the interactive laboratory of art, science & technology 
called Plataforma (Bogota, Colombia).

The idea was to make pieces of art interactives, to do so, we used
Arduinos, sensors and computers, more details will be given in each
README of each project directory (but libraries is not a project).

Enjoy !
Rita Dagaz, Jimmy & Drix ;)
