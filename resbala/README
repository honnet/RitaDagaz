Welcome to the resbala project !


Presentation
============

In this project, the idea is to make a physical picture interactive.
A schema is given in resbala.pdf but here is are a few explanations :

We have twice the same picture, one is cut in bands vertically, the other
horizontally.
The bands are weaved as in a banana leaf roof, the vertical bands are fixed,
the others bands are attached to tubes to be able to slide horizonally.
The left tube rotate due to the motor below, the right tube rotate due to a
belt connected to the motor.
The motor is controlled by an arduino which receives its data from an
ultrasonic sensor to detect the position of a visitor.
If a visitor is on the left side of the piece of art, the horizontal bands
will slide to the left, and vice versa.


Utilization
===========

In this project we used 2 libraries that are not always in the arduino
environment, it's already in the repository but here are the sources:
http://arduino.cc/playground/Code/Ping 
http://arduino.cc/playground/Main/RunningMedian

# To use them, go in the libraries folder of your arduino install :
cd /opt/arduino/libraries/              # adapt this line to your case

# and make links:
SKETCH_FOLDER=$HOME/sketchbook/         # adapt this too
ln -s $SKETCH_FOLDER/RitaDagaz/libraries/Ping/
ln -s $SKETCH_FOLDER/RitaDagaz/libraries/RunningMedian/


Enjoy ;)
