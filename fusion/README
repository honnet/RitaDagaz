Welcome to the fusion project !


Presentation
============

In this project, the idea is to to show, like in a Making-off, the composition
of a piece of art. In this case, it's a superposition of 2 pictures and our
dispositive allow to virtually separate these pictures.


Utilization
===========

The mouse wheel allows to fade to a picture.
The center click allows to reset to the original piece of art.


Enjoy ;)
